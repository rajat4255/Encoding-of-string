Question
Write a program to encode and decode a string.

Logic for encoding is:
For a single occurrence of a characters, let's say A is there 1 time, the encode should be B (A+1) where 1 is the number of occurrence. Had it been 2 occurrences, the logic would have been A+2 = C.

Encoding:
Input: WIINNNGGIIFFFFFFFYYYY
Output: XK2Q3I2K2M7C4

Decoding:
Input: XK2Q3I2K2M7C4
Output: WIINNNGGIIFFFFFFFYYYY
